# CSD-Project
## Introduction
This project involves assembling and programming an autonomous multi-robot system in a smart warehouse scenario. The involved robots, i.e., a \textit{robotic arm} and a \textit{smart car}, leverage a Raspberry Pi for computation and the Robot Operating System (ROS2), as the reference robotic framework for programming their behavior. 

After a detailed system analysis, the objective of the project is to develop a cooperative multi-robot system that can operate autonomously. 
More in detail the project will involve the robots' assembly phase, during which the essential functionalities of each robot will be identified, and the behavior implementation phase, which comprises robots' APIs development that will serve various functions, such as collecting data from sensors and controlling actuators.

Finally, once the APIs are developed and tested, the newly acquired knowledge and skills will be applied to deploy the cooperative multi-robot system in an industrial setting, recreating a smart warehouse scenario.
Notably, the key to enabling the achievement of the objective is the ROS2 framework. 
Indeed, it will allow the development of inter-robot communication thus creating a distributed and autonomous cooperative multi-robot system.
